            The worldwide phenomenon of Pokémon had it's humble beginning in
            Japan in the mid 1990's. Pokémon was the brainchild of Satoshi
            Tajiri. Tajiri spent many years trying to convince Nintendo that his
            idea, then called "Capule Monsters" based on his childhood love of
            catching and collecting insects and tadpoles, would be a success. He
            only found success once he engaged the help of his friends Ken
            Sugimore and Shigeru Miyamoto (creator of Legend of Zelda and Super
            Mario series). The first Pokémon games, Red and Green, were released
            in Japan on February 27, 1996. The games were such a success that
            the trading card game was developed and released in October of the
            same year. The continuing popularity of the games led to the release
            in North America with Red and Blue in 1998 along with dozens of
            anime, manga, film, and games since the series' original inception.
            With the debut of the film Detective Pikachu this past spring and a
            new game scheduled for release this fall (Sword and Shield), Pokémon
            shows no sign of slowing down.
